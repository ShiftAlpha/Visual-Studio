In this project we were required to build and produce Task 1 of our POE

In this production , i learned about collections , generic collections and most importantly dictionary collections 
to house and store information

I built several UIs, and attempted to created a seperate Library class , however , could not seem to be successful
in the SDK being a dependency, hence i have a seperate library class housing my abstract classes

The library class houses all abstract and extended classes, as well as certain calculations. 

In the next build, task 2, i will be sorting out the SDK dependency, in order to seperate the library solution from the
main solution

‌‌‌‌
At the end of this Task 1 , i Finally understand the benefits of dictionaries over arrays, and the difference between them as well as collections
I will improve on the final UI/UX as that is highly bland with a lack of colour. 
I will improve on the structure of the project, where the solutions are split, and in order to retrieve information from that solutions classes 
, one has to use the import/ using (in this case) 'ExpLibrary' as that would be the name of the solution , to the library. 
I will figure and sort out that SDK problem, to avoid the problem at whole, i seperated the classes and house those abstract and extended classes 
in a library folder, however, the folder is not in a seperate solution but within the current one, this shall be fixed. 

In order for me to commence with programming of calculations i used the siyavula link provided by the POE outline

Time taken: 7 hours‌
Lessons learned : Dictionaries, collections. Benefits & Set backs , as well comparison to arrays. 
Failed : SDK dependency for second solution to be 'connected' to first solution.
